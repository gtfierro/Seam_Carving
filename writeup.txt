We implemented a seam carving system for content-aware image resizing as described in Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir's 2007 paper. Since this image resizing is useful for dynamic web pages, we implemented the system in Javascript, allowing it's use in any web page. We used the HTML 5 canvas element to draw and manipulate the image data.


Seam carving attempts to change the aspect ratio or size of a picture while preserving the important content. Ideally, we would first remove the "lowest energy" pixels from the image to preserve the most important features. Doing this, however will create artifacts and not preserve the rectangular shape of the image. To balance removing low energy pixels while minimizing artifacts, we remove seams from the image that connect opposite ends of the image in a connected path. For example, a vertical seam on the image contains one pixel from each row, forming a connected path from top to bottom. To shrink the image, the lowest energy seam is removed and the process is repeated until the desired dimensions are reached.

To find the minimum energy seam, we first need to define an energy function. We used the gradient magnitude, though a number of other energy functions may work better for specific images. We found the gradient magnitude worked fine for most images. Once we have t
